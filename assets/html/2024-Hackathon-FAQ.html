    <h1>Hackathon FAQ</h1>

    <div class="question">
        How do I form a team?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can either form a team before the Hackathon and register together, or if you don’t have a team, register individually.
        During a live Zoom meeting on October 4, 2024, participants needing team members will have the opportunity to post
        about themselves and connect with others to form a team.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        What if I don’t have a team? What can I do?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        If you don't have a team, you can still register.
        Organizers will review registration information and create teams for participants who don't have team members,
        taking into consideration their skill sets (and age, if applicable).

        On October 4 at 2 pm, organizers will post a Google Sheet listing all teams formed from
        individual participants and teams with additional members.
        Organizers will encourage these teams to communicate with each other and finalize their team compositions by
        October 9 if any adjustments are needed.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        How old do I need to be to participate in the Hackathon?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You must be at least 13 years old to participate. If you are under 18,
        a parent or guardian must sign a consent form for your participation.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        How old do I need to be to win prizes in the Hackathon?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The same age requirement applies: you must be at least 13 years old,
        and those under 18 need to submit a Parent Consent Agreement Form to be eligible for prizes.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        What if I want to change teams?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        If you need to make changes to your team, you should discuss them during the team formation process
        after the team list is shared on October 4.
        You may also reach out to the organizers if you need further assistance.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        If my team doesn’t continue in the Hackathon, how can I still participate?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You can contact Dr. Nara (<a href="mailto:anara@sdsu.edu">anara@sdsu.edu</a>) to discuss options for rejoining or forming a new team.
        <!--You can contact Dr. Park (<a href="mailto:jpark1200@sdsu.edu">jpark1200@sdsu.edu</a>) to discuss options for rejoining or forming a new team.-->
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        What is the minimum and maximum number of team members required for the Hackathon?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Teams can have a maximum of 4 members. We recommend working in teams, but if you have a specific reason for working alone,
        reach out to Dr. Nara for special arrangements.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        Can my team be eligible for multiple awards?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Yes, teams can be eligible for multiple awards as long as they meet the criteria for each category.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        How do we obtain the award money if our team wins an award?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The award distribution process will be explained at the Hackathon. Typically, the prize will be divided among the team members.
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        Who do I contact if I have more questions about team formation?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        For any additional questions, you can reach out to Dr. Nara at <a href="mailto:anara@sdsu.edu">anara@sdsu.edu</a>.
